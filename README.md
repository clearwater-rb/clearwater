Clearwater is a rich front-end framework for building fast, reasonable, and easily composable browser applications in Ruby. It renders to a virtual DOM and applies the virtual DOM to the browser's actual DOM to update only what has changed on the page.

Installing
==========

Add these lines to your application's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'clearwater', '~> 1.0.0.rc2'
gem 'opal-rails' # Only needed for Rails apps
```

Using
=====

Clearwater has three distinct parts:

1. The component: the presenter and template engine
1. The router: the dispatcher and control
1. The application: the "Go" button

**The Component**
``` ruby
class Blog
  # All components need a set of behavior, but don't worry it's not a massive list.
  include Clearwater::Component

  # This method needs to return a virtual-DOM element using the element DSL.
  # The DSL is provided by the Clearwater::Component mixin.
  def render
    div([
      Articles.new,
      Biography.new,
    ])
  end
end
```

While we use two components in this example, you can use all of these as well:

``` ruby
# <div id="foo">
#   <h1>Heading</h1>
#   <article>hello!</article>
# </div>
def render
  div({ id: 'foo' }, [
    h1('Heading'),
    article('hello!'),
  ])
end

# <div>Hello, world!</div>
def render
  div('Hello, world!')
end

# <div>123</div>
def render
  div(123)
end

# <div></div>
def render
  div
end
```

**The Router**

``` ruby
router = Clearwater::Router.new do
  # A route with a block contains subordinate routes
  route 'blog' => Blog.new do # /blog
    route 'new_article' => NewArticle.new # /blog/new_article

    # This path contains a dynamic segment. Inside this component, you can use
    # router.params[:article_id] to return the value for this segment of the
    # URL. So for "/articles/123", router.params[:article_id] would be "123".
    route ':article_id' => ArticleReader.new # /blog/123
  end
end
```

## Using with Rails

You can also use Clearwater as part of the Rails asset pipeline. First create your Clearwater application (replace `app/assets/application.js` with this file):

``` ruby
# file: app/assets/javascripts/application.rb
require 'opal' # Not necessary if you load Opal from a CDN
require 'clearwater'

class Layout
  include Clearwater::Component

  def render
    h1('Hello, world!')
  end
end

app = Clearwater::Application.new(component: Layout.new)
app.call
```

Then, in `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`:

```erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <!-- snip -->

  <body>
    <!--
      We load the JS in the body tag to ensure the element exists so we can
      render to it. Otherwise, we need to use events on the document before we
      instantiate and call the Clearwater app. And that's no fun.
    -->
    <%= javascript_include_tag 'application' %>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then just create a root route that renders a blank template and refresh the page. You should see "Hello, world!" in big, bold letters. Congrats! You've built your first Clearwater app on Rails!

### Example app

```ruby
require 'opal'
require 'clearwater'
require 'ostruct'

class Layout
  include Clearwater::Component

  def render
    div({ id: 'app' }, [
      header({ class_name: 'main-header' }, [
        h1('Hello, world!'),
      ]),
      outlet, # This is what renders subordinate routes
    ])
  end
end

class Articles
  include Clearwater::Component

  def render
    div({ id: 'articles-container '}, [
      input({ class_name: 'search-articles', onkeyup: method(:search) }),
      ul({ id: 'articles-index' }, articles.map { |article|
        ArticlesListItem.new(article)
      }),
      outlet, # This is what renders subordinate routes (e.g. Article)
    ])
  end

  def articles
    @articles ||= MyStore.fetch_articles

    if @query
      @articles.select { |article| article.match?(@query) }
    else
      @articles
    end
  end

  def search(event)
    @query = event.target.value
    call # Rerender the app
  end
end

class ArticlesListItem
  include Clearwater::Component

  attr_reader :article

  def initialize(article)
    @article = article
  end

  def render
    # Note the "key" key in this hash. This is a hint to the virtual DOM that
    # if this node is moved around, it can still reuse the same element.
    li({ key: article.id, class_name: 'article' }, [
      # The Link component will rerender the app for the new URL on click
      Link.new({ href: "/articles/#{article.id}" }, article.title),
      time({ class_name: 'timestamp' }, article.timestamp.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')),
    ])
  end
end

class Article
  include Clearwater::Component

  def render
    # In addition to using HTML5 tag names as methods, you can use the `tag`
    # method with a query selector to generate a tag with those attributes.
    tag('article.selected-article', nil, [
      h1({ class_name: 'article-title' }, article.title),
      time({ class_name: 'article-timestamp' }, article.timestamp.strftime('%m-%d-%Y')),
      section({ class_name: 'article-body' }, article.body),
    ])
  end

  def article
    # params[:article_id] is the section of the URL that contains what would be
    # the `:article_id` parameter in the router below.
    MyStore.article(params[:article_id])
  end

  def match? query
    query.split.all? { |token|
      title.include?(token) || body.include?(token)
    }
  end
end

module MyStore
  extend self
  DB = 5.times.map do |n|
    OpenStruct.new(id: n, timestamp: Time.new, title: "Random thoughts n.#{n}", body: 'Some deep stuff')
  end

  def fetch_articles
    DB
  end

  def article(id)
    id = id.to_i
    DB.find {|a| a.id == id}
  end
end

router = Clearwater::Router.new do
  route 'articles' => Articles.new do
    route ':article_id' => Article.new
  end
end

MyApp = Clearwater::Application.new(
  component: Layout.new,
  router: router,
  element: Bowser.document.body # This is the default target element
)

MyApp.call # Render the app.
```
